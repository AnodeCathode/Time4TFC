- Changes the day/night cycle for each month in Terrafirmacraft-NG for Minecraft 1.12.2.

Based almost entirely on DMillerW excellent little mod TooMuchTime for MC 1.7.10. Anything that works is based on his work. Anything broken is Anode's mess.

Config allows changing of each months day amount up to 18000 ticks (by default that is the July amount).
